## Last week {background-color="#FDBF57"}

::: incremental
- **Representative surveys** as the gold standard of public opinion research

- Challenging to decide:

    - What to ask
    - Who to ask
:::

## Today {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- A little more about **data strategies**

- ... and how they translate into **answer strategies**

- Research designs for sensitive questions

- **Lab:** Practice writing research designs on your own

# Data Strategies {background-color="#FDBF57"}

## Elements of a data strategy

::: incremental
1. Sampling 

2. Treatment assignment 

3. Measurement

## Elements of a data strategy

## Why do people lie in surveys?

::: incremental


1. Inattention

2. Satisficing

3. Limited options

4. Demand effects

5. Sensitivity bias

## How to prevent lying?

::: incremental

- Add noise to the question

- Two approaches:

1. Distract from the sensitive attitude/behavior

2. Guarantee anonymity

- Different designs vary on how they combine the two

## Randomized response

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*.

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw.

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*.

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*. If {{< fa dice-six >}} shows, tell me *yes*.

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*. If {{< fa dice-six >}} shows, tell me *yes*. But if another number shows, tell me your own opinion about the question.

[TURN AWAY FROM RESPONDENT]

Now you throw the dice so that I cannot see what comes out.

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*. If {{< fa dice-six >}} shows, tell me *yes*. But if another number shows, tell me your own opinion about the question.

[TURN AWAY FROM RESPONDENT]

&nbsp;

Have you thrown the dice?

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*. If {{< fa dice-six >}} shows, tell me *yes*. But if another number shows, tell me your own opinion about the question.

&nbsp;

[TURN AWAY FROM RESPONDENT]

&nbsp;

Have you picked it up?

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*. If {{< fa dice-six >}} shows, tell me *yes*. But if another number shows, tell me your own opinion about the question.

&nbsp;

Now, during the height of the conflict in 2007 and 2008 *(in Afghanistan)*, did you know any militants, like a family member, a friend, or someone you talked to on a regular basis? 

. . .

Please, before you answer, take note of the number you rolled on the dice.

## Answer strategy

::: incremental

- We know that about $1/6 \approx 0.17$ respondents said *yes* because they rolled a {{< fa dice-six >}}

- So if $30\%$ in total said *yes*

- We have $\widehat{Y} = 0.3 - 0.17 = 0.13$ as our *population estimate*

- But we **do not know** who they are in our survey!

:::

## Assumptions

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
### 1. Honesty given protection

People respond honestly when guaranteed anonymity.

:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
### 2. One-sided lying

Those who **do not** hold the sensitive trait **never** falsely claim to bear it.

:::

. . .

- These cannot be verified with data!

## List experiment

Now I am going to read you three things that make people angry or upset.

## List experiment {visibility="uncounted"}

Now I am going to read you three things that make people angry or upset. After I read all three, just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you.

## List experiment {visibility="uncounted"}

Now I am going to read you three things that make people angry or upset. After I read all three, just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you. I don't want to know which ones, just HOW MANY.

. . .

### Control group

::: incremental
1. The federal government increasing the tax on gasoline
2. Professional athletes getting million-dollar contracts
3. Large corporations polluting the environment

## List experiment {visibility="uncounted"}

### Treatment group

1. The federal government increasing the tax on gasoline
2. Professional athletes getting million-dollar contracts
3. Large corporations polluting the environment
4. **A black family moving next door**

## Answer strategy

::: incremental

- Respondents are randomly assigned to conditions

- Differences in responses can only be attributed to the presence/absence of the sensitive item

- So $\widehat{Y} = \text{Mean(treatment)} - \text{Mean(control)}$ our *prevalence rate* estimator

- But we **do not know** who they are in our survey!

:::

## Assumptions

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
### 1. No liars

Those who **do not** hold the sensitive item **never** falsely claim to bear it.

:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
### 2. No design effects

Including the sensitive item **does not change** how participants respond to the baseline items

:::

. . .

- These can only be evaluated **indirectly**



## Other research designs

::: incremental

- Building trust with respondents

- [Endorsement experiments](https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpr031)

- [Conjoint experiments](https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2021.30)

- [Network scale-up method](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2021.1935267)

- Variants of the randomized response and list experiment
