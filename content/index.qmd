title: "Content Overview"
---

You can use the sidebar to navigate the course content organized by weeks. 

For each week, you will find:

- A brief **overview** of the week's topic

- A list of the **required readings**. Both sections of the **textbook** {{< fa book >}} and **research articles** {{< fa file-lines >}}.

## Accessing readings off-campus
Use [this link](https://library.mcmaster.ca/services/off-campus-access) for instructions to access library resources off-campus. I find the browser bookmarklet helpful.
:::

- Links to the slides in **HTML** {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} and **PDF** [{{< fa file-pdf >}}]{style="color: red;"}

::: {.callout-note}
I like to make HTML slides to include code and animations. I make PDF slides available in case you want to print or save them locally.

- Links to the corresponding **weekly lab assignment** {{< fa laptop-code >}}

::: {.callout-tip}
You can download [{{< fa brands r-project >}}]{style="color: blue;"} file for the assignments, edit it with your work, and compile it to PDF when you are ready to submit!
