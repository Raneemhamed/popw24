## Overview

Last week we learned about survey experiments. These are increasingly being conducted of convenience samples of online survey respondents. This brings questions about whether the results of experiments can generalize to the population of interest. When a finding can be generalized to a broader population, we say that it has **external validity**.

The lab explores the concept of external validity and its different flavors.
