See the syllabus for formatting and extension guidelines.\nIf you are working off the template, see https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf for some tips on common writing operations in Rmarkdown.\nStart by replacing the relevant information in the preamble of the document. Including the number of the response paper, your personal details, and the reference to the week about which you are writing the paper.\nThe Overview section should indicate which reading for the week you are discussing, it summarizes its main finding and relevance in 2-3 sentences, and then briefly highlights the point that you want to make in your response. For example, in this response paper I want to criticize the use of a convenience sample instead of a representative sample. The overview should not take more than 2-3 paragraphs."
