## Welcome!

This course is about **quantitative research designs** applied to **public opinion and policy**

. . .

-   **Quantitative:** Data analysis using statistics and statistical programming software

. . .

-   **Research design:** Thinking about how research is conducted

## Welcome! {visibility="uncounted"}

This course is about **quantitative research designs** applied to **public opinion and policy**

-   **Public opinion:** Views among the "general" public

. . .

-   **(Public) policy:** Government actions and how to carry them (decision making)

## Why public opinion and policy?

. . .
