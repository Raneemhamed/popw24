**POLSCI 4SS3**  
Winter 2024
:::

## Announcements {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

- I received accommodation letters. Schedule a meeting if you need anything beyond extra time for completing assignments

- Labs now due at 11:59 PM instead of 5 PM (haven't updated syllabus yet)

- Submit lab 1! It's easy and I won't penalize you if you are late this time


## Last week {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- Overview of course topic, goals, evaluation, expectations

- We installed R and RStudio and explored them a bit

- Cloud option always available if all else fails

- More details in the [course website {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}}](https://popw23.gustavodiaz.org/)

## Today {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- Talk about what research design means in the context of this course

- Overview of the MIDA research design workflow


- **Takeaway:** Research design as a set of steps that can be *encoded* and *interrogated*

- **{{< fa laptop-code >}} Lab:** Intro to R

# Research Design {background-color="#FDBF57"}
:::


## What is a research design?

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}} RD:** A procedure for generating answers to questions

- **More generally:** Thinking about how research is *(was, will be)* conducted

- **Emphasis:** We can **program** and **interrogate** elements of a research design

:::

## {{< fa book >}} Elements of research design

::: incremental

1. **Model *(M)* **

2. **Inquiry *(I)* **

3. **Data strategy *(D)* **

4. **Answer strategy *(A)* **

:::

## Model

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}}:** A **set** of **speculations** about **what causes what** and **how**

- **Set:** We consider many models because we are uncertain of how the world works

- **Speculation:** All models are wrong, some models are useful

- **What causes what:** Informs the *event generating process* (e.g. variables, distributions, correlations)

- **How:** An explanation of why things are connected or correlated

:::

::: {style="text-align: center"}
## Examples of models? {.center}


**Hint:** Models are also called theories (of change), arguments, claims, beliefs, epistemologies, ideologies, hunches, conjectures

:::

## Inquiry

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}}:** A research question stated in terms of the model

- In this course, we will talk about **quantities of interest** or **estimands**

- **Estimands**, **estimators**, and **estimates** are different things with annoyingly similar names!

- Some questions will lend themselves to multiple inquiries. We will tend to focus on those with one or a handful


:::

## Examples of inquiries

. . .

1. What is the proportion of unemployed people in the country?
    
2. What is the effect of immigration on economic development?
    
3. Do people support funding private clinics to mitigate surgery backlogs?
    
4. Will the stock market crash this year?

5. Individual causal effect $\tau_i = Y_{i}(1)-Y_{i}(0)$


## A note on notation {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Greek

::: incremental

- Letters like $\mu$ denote **estimands**

- A hat $\hat{\mu}$ denotes **estimators**

:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Latin

::: incremental

- Letters like $X$ denote **actual variables** in our data

- A bar $\bar{X}$  denotes an **estimate** calculated from our data

$X \rightarrow \bar{X} \rightarrow \hat{\mu} \xrightarrow{\text{hopefully!}} \mu$


&nbsp;


$\text{Data} \rightarrow \text{Estimate} \rightarrow \text{Estimator} \xrightarrow{\text{hopefully!}} \text{Estimand}$
::: 


## Data strategy

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}}:** Set of **procedures** used to **gather information** from the world

- Three features:

    1. How *units* are selected
    
    2. How *conditions* are assigned
    
    3. How *outcomes* are measured

:::

::: aside
Not all research designs need feature #2
:::

## Elements of data strategies

::: incremental

- **Sampling:** Random, stratified, snowball

- **Assignment:** Two-arm, multi-arm, factorial

- **Measurement:** Number of measures, time periods, data-adaptive

:::

## Answer strategy

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}}:** How we summarize the data produced by the data strategy

- Data *is* **too complicated** to speak for itself

- Needs summary and explanation

- Most **research methods** qualify as **answer strategies**

:::

## Types of answer strategies

::: incremental
1. **Point estimation:** Single value answer

2. **Hypothesis test:** Yes/no answer based on (statistical) procedure 

3. **Bayesian:** How likely different answers are given prior beliefs and data

4. **Interval estimation:** Identify a range of plausible answers
:::

## Types of answer strategies


1. **Point estimation:** Single value answer

2. **Hypothesis test:** Yes/no answer based on (statistical) procedure 

3. ~~**Bayesian:** How likely different answers are given prior beliefs and data~~

4. ~~**Interval estimation:** Identify a range of plausible answers~~

. . .

- They all include procedures to quantify **uncertainty**

## Parallels

MIDA research designs have an **theoretical** and an **empirical** part:

. . .


```{r dd, include = FALSE}
dd = tribble(
  ~Theory, ~Empirics,
  "Model", "Data strategy",
  "Inquiry", "Answer strategy"
)
```

```{r showdd, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
dd %>% kbl()
```

## Tip before you start {{< fa lightbulb >}}

- Last week, we created a project folder/directory for the class

- Save all lab `.qmd` files in the same directory

- {{< fa brands r-project >}} will automatically recognize all files within the project directory

- Continue using the same project for all lab assignments
