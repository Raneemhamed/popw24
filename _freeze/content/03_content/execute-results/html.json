The main reason why social scientists conduct surveys is to infer real-world attitudes and behaviors. However, this presents a very difficulty measurement problem. How should questions be asked to produce an accurate measure of the attitude or behavior of interest?\n\nAs the name suggests, a representative survey is administered to a sample of respondents that resemble the demographic characteristics of the underlying population.\n\nThe punchline of this week is that conducting a true representative survey via random sampling is near impossible. Instead, most surveys use some form of quota or stratified sampling to ensure that the sample obtained resembles the  population of interest.\n\nThe lab assignment for this week will be a guided introduction to R. By the end, we will compare different sampling techniques.\n\n## Reading\n\n- {{< fa book >}} [RD sections 5-7, 15](https://book.declaredesign.org/declaration-diagnosis-redesign/declaring-designs.html) \n\n- {{< fa file-lines >}} Schwarz, Norbert. 1999.
